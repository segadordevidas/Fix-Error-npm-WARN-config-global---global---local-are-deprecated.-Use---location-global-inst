# Fix Error npm WARN config global `--global`, `--local`, are deprecated. Use `--location=global` instead.

To solve this error follow these instructions:

We enter the Nodejs Folder of our PC:
C:/> Program Files > nodejs>
Once here we will copy the 2 npm files and paste them on the desktop.

We will open the npm text file with visual studio or the program you use and change the code: (prefix -g) by (prefix â€“location=global)

The other npm file we will open with the edit form and do the same.

Then we will take the 2 modified files and replace them with the original ones from the nodejs folder.
And you will already have it solved ;)
